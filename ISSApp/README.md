## Mappedin ISS Map

![ISS Demo](/ISSApp/ISSDemo.gif)


This map of the International Space Station is publically available for anyone to use in the 2020 
NASA International Space Apps Challenge! The example displayed here uses our Web SDK which you can find more information about on our [developer portal](https://developer.mappedin.com).


## Potential Ideas
A couple of potential ideas for using this map are:

1. A maintenance application (Create an app that lists maintenance tasks that need to be performed on the ISS and display them on the map along with repair status)
2. Astronaut Position Tracking (Create an app that monitors astronaut health and tracks their position in the ISS, place markers to where the astronauts are and list them when a user clicks on a location)

If you have any questions on how to use the SDK, feel free to contact me (Sean Lin) on the Space Apps discord channel.
